Let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl They were just sixteen when the people were mean So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone Headstones on a lawn

And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more 'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered 'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say Moved to different states

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works But I think that it could work for you and me Just wait and see It's not the end of the story

Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet If we worked and we saved, we could both run away And we'd have a better life, and I was right I wonder if she's alright

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works But I think that it could work for you and me Just wait and see It's not the end of the story Okay

And the movie's always runnin' in my head All the people, all the lovers, all my friends And I hope that they all get their happy end In the end
